With this pubspec.yaml dependency configuration, renovate can't pull the version from the "ref" field, I tried by regex, but my configuration still didn't work either, here is the error log
```json

"depType": "dependencies",
"depName": "localization",
"currentValue": null,
"depIndex": 2,
"updates": [],
"warnings": [],
"versioning": "npm",
"skipReason": "invalid-value"
